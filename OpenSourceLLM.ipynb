It enables applications that:Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)This framework consists of several parts.LangChain Libraries: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.LangChain Templates: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.LangServe: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle:Develop: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference.Productionize: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence.Deploy: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.LangChain Libraries\\u200bThe main value props of the LangChain packages are:Components: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or notOff-the-shelf chains: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasksOff-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.The LangChain libraries themselves are made up of several different packages.langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.langchain-community: Third party integrations.langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.Get started\\u200bHere’s how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.We recommend following our Quickstart guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.Read up on our Security best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain.noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. Head here for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\u200bLCEL is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex chains.Overview: LCEL and its benefitsInterface: The standard interface for LCEL objectsHow-to: Key features of LCELCookbook: Example code for accomplishing common tasksModules\\u200bLangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules:Model I/O\\u200bInterface with language modelsRetrieval\\u200bInterface with application-specific dataAgents\\u200bLet models choose which tools to use given high-level directivesExamples, ecosystem, and resources\\u200bUse cases\\u200bWalkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use cases, like:Document question answeringChatbotsAnalyzing structured dataand much more...Integrations\\u200bLangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.

LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex chains. Overview: LCEL and its benefits. Interface: The LCEL interface allows for chaining of multiple steps together, with each step being represented by a function or method. This allows for the creation of complex pipelines and workflows, without the need for complex programming or scripting. The benefits of using LCEL include:\\n\\n1. Declarative: LCEL is a declarative language, which means that it is used to describe the desired output, rather than the steps needed to achieve it. This makes it easier to understand and maintain, as the logic is written in a more natural and intuitive way.\\n\\n2. No code changes: LCEL allows for the creation of complex pipelines and workflows, without the need for complex programming or scripting. This means that changes to the pipeline can be made without the need for recompilation or re-deployment, which can save time and resources.\\n\\n3. Reusability: LCEL allows for the creation of reusable components, which can be used across multiple pipelines and workflows. This can save time and resources, as well as improve consistency\""
